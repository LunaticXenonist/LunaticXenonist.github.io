        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I will use my talents and skills to go into a fulfilling career that makes enough to support me and
            my future family. I will create deep connections with the people around me, and spend time with
            those I care about. I will do fun things and not take life too seriously, while making sure to
            constantly improve myself.</p>
